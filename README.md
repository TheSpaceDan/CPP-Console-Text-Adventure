# CPP-Console-Text-Adventure
A C++ console text adventure game we made during our first semester at University.

In this, you'll go through an adventure where you have multiple choices to make, and each choice you make will affect the story. This is just very little something we made for our Programming Fundamentals Course, have fun playing :D
